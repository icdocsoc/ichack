1. Read relevant portions of the documentation.

> [!note]
> All ichack related systems every year are **private**. Feel free to fork this repository but keep it private.

## Documentation

This is the first time the repository will have extensive documentation. Open [the folder](./documentation/) as an [Obsidian Vault](https://obsidian.md).

> [!important]
> The documentation started authoring from 4th July 2024. The contributors will try to document this code as much as possible and encourage the future volunteers to do so as well. However, it may not be the case that everything is documented perfectly.
>
> As a result, some or most of the pages here will be incomplete. Over time, we will do our best that it does not happen.
>
> The tense used in the documentation will be confusing depending on the date it was written and the event that was spoken about.

## Development rules

### Creating a branch

No person can directly on the main branch. Hence you need to create a new branch to make any changes to the main branch. This rule might change closer to the event.

### Creating a PR

You should create a PR **as soon as** you create a branch.

1. If the PR is not ready, create a _Draft_ PR. This is so that others know what is being worked on and can provide some feedback before you are knee deep into the feature.
1. The actual commit messages within your PR **does not follow** any conventional naming pattern. However, your PR title must follow `type: description` format.
1. If the main branch has changes and your branch needs to be updated, rebase the main branch (not git merge).

## Documentation

This is the first time the repository will have extensive documentation. Open [the folder](./documentation/) as an [Obsidian Vault](https://obsidian.md).

> [!important]
> The documentation started authoring from 4th July 2024. The contributors will try to document this code as much as possible and encourage the future volunteers to do so as well. However, it may not be the case that everything is documented perfectly.
>
> As a result, some or most of the pages here will be incomplete. Over time, we will do our best that it does not happen.
>
> The tense used in the documentation will be confusing depending on the date it was written and the event that was spoken about.

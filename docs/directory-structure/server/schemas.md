# Schemas

Nishant looked at different sources to build the schema and understand how to use [Drizzle](../../technologies/drizzle) to connect it to [PostgreSQL](../../tech-stack/postgresql). One was [Lucia's example repo](https://github.com/lucia-auth/examples/tree/main/hono/username-and-password) and the other was last year's firebase database. Nishant converted the important mandatory bits of it to an SQL table schema.

All schemas live under `src/*/schema.ts`. Read the files comments to understand more.

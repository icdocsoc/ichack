# Digital Ocean

We are using Digital Ocean to deploy our app on. We are lucky to have spoken to Digital Ocean representatives and received a generous amount of free credits. Since DoCSoc is a non-profit charity organisation, they had a program to give us more free credit that's valid for a year. The higher-ups are trying to get them to partner with us and potentially sponsor IC Hack so we have DO as our main cloud platform provider for many years to come.

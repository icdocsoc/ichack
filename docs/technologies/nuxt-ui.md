# Nuxt UI

A set of components and tools by the Nuxt Team that helps develop UI faster. This becomes with many built-in capabilities but customising the UI is a pain since it is quite restrictive. So this was used only by the admin page and not the rest since we require the UI building freedom and we're unaware of the extent of customisability Nuxt UI provides.

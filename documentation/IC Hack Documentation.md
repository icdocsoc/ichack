IC Hack is Europe's Largest Hackathon, hosted by Imperial College's DoCSoc. You will find the entire code base on [GitHub](https://github.com/icdocsoc/ichack25). This documentation will give you extensive details on the code, workflow and design choices made by our Webmasters - Nishant and Jay - and other long term volunteers.
## How to get started?
1. Learn about [[Why do this|why we did what we did]].
3. Try out our code by [[Running the project locally]].
4. Look at the [[Directory Structure]] and understand what is placed where.

> As you can see, this page was authored on 4th July 2024. Very preliminary code of the server was written at this point. We will try to document this code as much as possible and encourage the future volunteers to do so as well. However, it may not be the case that everything is documented perfectly.

> As a result, some or most of the pages here will be incomplete. Over time, we will do our best that it does not happen.

> The tense used in the documentation will be confusing depending on the date it was written and the event that was spoken about

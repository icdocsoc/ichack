This year, the admin page is more important than ever. We need a GUI layer over the custom server being built alongside. This helps in testing the server and solving any issues towards the day of IC Hack. 

Admin page access will only be given to a subset of tech volunteers. This gives God **(and Admin)** level access to the entire systems.

Jay's been on a holiday for a bit and I had some free time, so I coded a bit of the server and when it got to a point where I was confident with the vision of the project, I decided to start writing down before everything else gets piled up. 

I should probably add testing and inline documentation for the server code since I *now* understand what I have written myself xD.

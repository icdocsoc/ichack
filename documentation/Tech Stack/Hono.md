Hono's [website](https://hono.dev)

Just a choice from Nishant, really. [[Bun]] was chosen since it is quite fast and Hono works well with it. There's good support online, as I believe. Knowing how to build an Express app, it is easy to understand and implement without many problems.  

## Why not Elysia?

Elysia is also a great choice, but it is one person (@SaltyAom) building the entire thing. It is great but it got issues and tons of them on github that aren't being attended to. 

## Why not Express?

A bit too old.

## Why not Nest.js?

Too much structure and boilerplate.

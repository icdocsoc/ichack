Bun's [website](https://bun.sh)

Bun is an extremely fast Javascript/Typescript runtime environment. Github support is good. 

## Problems with Bun

Nishant faced one issue with Bun regarding containerising it with [[Docker]]. It is an ongoing [issue on github](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/12252). Check it out to know what exactly was the issue.

## Why not the others?

PNPM was a good contender with it's great workspaces support. They just aren't bun, and bun is faster than all the others by a big mile.
